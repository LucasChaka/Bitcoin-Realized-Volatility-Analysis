# Bitcoin-Realized-Volatility-Analysis

This Master's seminar project provides a comprehensive analysis of the realized volatility (RV) of Bitcoin price time series using the HAR-RV model. The analysis covers various aspects, including the theoretical model itself and its empirical application to Bitcoin. Originally conducted using R, this project has been adapted to include Python and SQL codes for public accessibility and reference.
